var foo = function(){};

foo.kung = "hiyaaaaa";

console.log(foo.kung);



//Experiment 1: turn this into a named function and print kung to the console from within the function.

//Experiment 2: rename the function Foo. 
//Use the this keyword to set the kung property 
//instantiate a new version of the function called foo
//check that foo.kung == "hiyaaaaa";
